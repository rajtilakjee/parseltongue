Finally in the Redirect URI field fill in a call route for your app, it should look something like this: https://www.myredditapp.com/callback.</p>","tags":["reddit","authorization","oauth2"]},{"location":"blog/2024/12/18/reddit-auth/#done-now-what","title":"...done!

The app begins the authorization process when a user lands on the homepage. Define a route in your app for this entry point, it can be something as simple as the following code:</p> <pre><code>@app.route(\"/\")\ndef homepage():\n    authorize_url = make_authorization_url()\n    return render_template(\"index.html\", authorize_url=authorize_url)\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>make_authorization_url</code> function generates the URL for Reddit's authorization page dynamically to ensure flexibility and security. By constructing the URL on-the-fly, the app can incorporate unique parameters such as a randomly generated <code>state</code> for preventing CSRF attacks and a tailored <code>redirect_uri</code>. These parameters not only enhance the security of the authentication process but also ensure that the app can handle user-specific flows, such as redirecting users to appropriate locations after successful authorization.</p> <pre><code>def make_authorization_url():\n    state = str(uuid4())  # Generate a random state to prevent CSRF attacks\n    save_created_state(state)  # (Optional) Save the state for validation later\n\n    params = {\n        \"client_id\": CLIENT_ID,\n        \"response_type\": \"code\",\n        \"state\": state,\n        \"redirect_uri\": REDIRECT_URI,\n        \"duration\": \"temporary\",\n        \"scope\": \"identity\",\n    }\n    url = \"https://ssl.reddit.com/api/v1/authorize?\" + urllib.parse.urlencode(params)\n    return url\n</code></pre> <p>This function does the following:</p> <ul> <li>Generates a random <code>state</code> parameter to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.</li> <li>Constructs the authorization URL with the required query parameters, including:<ul> <li><code>client_id</code>: Your app's Reddit client ID.</li> <li><code>redirect_uri</code>: The URL where Reddit will send the user after authentication.</li> <li><code>scope</code>: The permissions being requested (in this case, \"identity\" to access the username).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>When the user clicks the authorization link, they are redirected to Reddit's authorization page.</p>","tags":["reddit","authorization","oauth2"]},{"location":"blog/2024/12/18/reddit-auth/#okay-but-how-do-we-handle-the-callback","title":"Okay, but how do we handle the callback?","text":"<p>After the user grants or denies access, Reddit redirects them back to the app via the <code>redirect_uri</code>.
